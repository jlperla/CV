# CV
See https://github.com/aarmey/CV for the original (and superior) setup.

To use this framework:
- Make a new repository and copy the materials in, or fork this one.
- Ensure the repository is publicly open.
- In the settings on the repo, turn on Github Pages and for the `Source` dropdown choose the `gh-pages` branch.
  - If the choice isn't available, run the action once and then it should be.
- modify the `makefile`
  - Find/replace any `perla_cv` with your own filename

The address of the compiled CV is then:
https://jlperla.github.io/CV/perla_cv.pdf or equivalent.
